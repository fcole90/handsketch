# Overview
HandSketch is a prototype of application intended as an experiment of Human-Computer interaction. The idea behind it is to develop a set of toolbars for a raster drawing application which rely only on gestual interaction to switch drawing instruments and their settings, allowing the mouse cursor to not leave the canvas during drawing. The gestual input is provided through a Leap Motion sensor.

The program provides very basic drawing instuments on a raster canvas. It has a side toolbar whose widgets provide the selection of the active drawing tool, the color and the tool options. Each widget is activated and controlled through a proper rotation gesture, and the numeric value of the settings is controlled with a circle gesture.

#### Input choice

# Compile and run
Just make the application, running on the command line (requires `make` and `awk`):
```bash
make
```
and then open the resulting file `HandSketch.html` in your web browser.

### Libs
All third party libraries should go inside the `lib` folder. Bootstrap plugins should go inside `bootstrap-plugins`. When downloading a plugin, it should have a `dist` folder that contains js and css subfolders. Check the folder structure of the plugin and put its `dist` folder under bootstrap-plugins, renaming it to `plugin_name`. If the plugin does not have a `dist` folder, take the relevant js and css files and create the needed structure.

### HTML
HTML code is divided into different files inside the html folder, one file for each relevant component of the UI. The main page is in the html/main.html file. The other files are included inside it during the preprocessing (make). To include a component into the main page, place the code `<!-- #include file_name.html -->` inside the main.html file, in the appropriated position. To preprocess, run `make`: the HandSketch.html page will be compiled and put into the root folder of the project.

### JavaScript
Custom JavaScript functions should go inside a file in the js folder. Keep grouped into a file with a consistent name the functions which are related to a specific html component.

### CSS
Custom CSS stylesheet files should go into the css folder.

## Style conventions
Comment your code in a way that everybody can understand what's happening or, if you find it more motivating, as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent armed psychopath who knows where you live. Some team members actually are psychopaths and well armed, so you have been warned. Use [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html) format when documenting functions. Also include a file comment at the beginning of JavaScript files, providing at least a brief and "@author" and "@date yyyy-mm-dd" tags.

The indentation is of 4 spaces (convert tab to spaces in your code). Anyone leaving tabs in the code will be LARTed without mercy.

The maximum length for code lines is peremptorily of 80 characters for JavaScript and CSS files. But HTML sucks, so the limit is not applied to HTML files, just try to keep a reasonable line length there.

## Git memorandum for dummies

1. Fork the repo here on github
2. Clone your repo with ```git clone *repo_address*```
3. cd to the project folder and make a new branch with ```git checkout -b *feature-branch-name*```
4. Work on the feature
5. When ready send your code with ```git push -u origin *feature-branch-name*```
6. Send a pull request
